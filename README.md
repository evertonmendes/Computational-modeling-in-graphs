# Computational-modeling-in-graphs



This repository contains the projects referring to the subject SCC0216. Traditional mathematics turned real problems into mathematical formulations, such as graphs, to facilitate long-term solution. With this in mind, computational studies were carried out in order to solve optimization problems using concepts such as adjacency matrix, adjacency list, trees.
