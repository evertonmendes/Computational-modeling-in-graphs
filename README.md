# Computational-modeling-in-graphs



This repository contains the projects referring to the subject SCC0216. Traditional mathematics turned real problems into mathematical formulations, such as graphs, to facilitate long-term solution. With this in mind, computational studies were carried out in order to solve optimization problems using concepts such as adjacency matrix, adjacency list, trees.

Final Project
  
    Given a DAG(Direct Acyclic Graph), which each vertex have two parents or none.
    A - Find vertexs wih no parents.
    B - Find sink vertexs.
    C - Find sink vertexs whose parents are descendant of 1.
    D - Vertexs with minimum d[X]+d[Y], where X and Y are the parents of vertexs founded at item "C", and d is distance vector of each vertex to 1.
